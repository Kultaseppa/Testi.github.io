I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.

## Exercise 2
**BBCode**

BBCode (Bulletin Board Code) is a lightweight markup language used to format posts in message boards, forums, and online communities. It was designed to be easy to use and parse, and is similar to HTML in its basic syntax. BBCode allows users to add formatting, links, and media to their posts, and is often used in place of HTML to reduce the risk of cross-site scripting attacks.

**R Markdown**

R Markdown is a variant of Markdown that is specifically designed for creating documents that contain R code and results. It is an open-source format that allows users to embed R code, output, and graphics in a single document, making it easy to create reproducible reports and documents. R Markdown is commonly used for data analysis, scientific research, and technical writing, and is a powerful tool for creating dynamic documents that combine text, code, and data visualization.
